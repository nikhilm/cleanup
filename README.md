Cleanup ( i'll think of a better name soon enough )
===================================================

Cleanup is a game based on [Solarwolf](http://www.pygame.org/shredwheat/solarwolf/).

It is my first attempt to use Canvas and Javascript for games.

Cleanup will be my entry for the May 2009 game contest on [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com)

src/test.html is the file you would want to open in your browser once you clone the repository.

Click on the canvas ( black rectangle ) to watch things happen.

Use the arrow keys to move the center right chef, the other stationary chef is a plate
you are to collect it.

_Why do I just have chefs everywhere?_
Because a friend who is going to create the graphics is busy right now

TODO
----
A lot of things

Currently the top and left monsters shoot out bullets very fast, I've to debug that
