Cleanup
===================================================

_UPDATE_: Cleanup is now done. Play it
at [http://www.codechef.com/MAYGAMER/viewgame/cleanup/].
It won a special mention as the best JS game!
Thanks to Denny George for the graphics.

Cleanup is a game based on [Solarwolf](http://www.pygame.org/shredwheat/solarwolf/).

It is my first attempt to use Canvas and Javascript for games.

Cleanup was my entry for the May 2009 game contest on [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com)

Use the arrow keys to move the center right chef, the other stationary chefs are the plates you've to collect.
