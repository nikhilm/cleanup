Cleanup ( i'll think of a better name soon enough )
===================================================

Cleanup is a game based on [Solarwolf](http://www.pygame.org/shredwheat/solarwolf/).

It is my first attempt to use Canvas and Javascript for games.

Cleanup will be my entry for the May 2009 game contest on [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com)

src/index.html is the file you would want to open in your browser once you clone the repository.

Use the arrow keys to move the center right chef, the other stationary chefs are the plates you've to collect.

_Why do I just have chefs everywhere?_
Because a friend who is going to create the graphics is busy right now

TODO
----
 * Add scoring system
 * Allow levels and so on to introduce one off help comments
